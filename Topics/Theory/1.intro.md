#### What is React? 
 - React is a free and open source javascript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and
   UI components
 - Build by facebook
 - It is used for developing single page applications

#### Limitations of the React
 - Do not provide features like routing, state management, API calls for which we will have to 
   depend on other third party libraries
 - React uses client side rendering where components are generated in the browser using javascript
 - This can cause problem for SEO and indexing 
 - To solve this we can use Nextjs which is a React frame work


#### What is DOM (document object model)
 - It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects
 - The DOM allows scripts like JavaScript to access and manipulate the content, structure, 
   and style of a web page after it has been loaded by a browser

#### Virtual Dom 
 - VDOM is a concept used by js libraries like React to improve performance of the web applications
 - It's a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. 


 #### Working of React
 Initial Render: 
 When a React component is first rendered, a Virtual DOM tree is created. This tree is a replica of the real 
 DOM, composed of JavaScript objects.


State Change: 
When a user interacts with the application (e.g., clicking a button) and the application's state changes, a 
new Virtual DOM tree is created.

**Diffing**: 
React then uses a "diffing" algorithm to compare the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one. This 
process efficiently pinpoints exactly which objects have changed.


**Reconciliation**: 
Once the differences are identified, React generates a minimal set of instructions to update only the 
necessary parts of the real DOM. This process is called reconciliation.

### Dynamic Rendering 
Dynamic rendering means rendering UI elements that change based on
- state
- props
- conditions
- data fetched from APIs
- user interactions
