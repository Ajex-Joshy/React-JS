What is React? 
 - React is a free and open source javascript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and
   UI components
 - Build by facebook
 - It is used for developing single page applications

Limitations of the React
 - Do not provide features like routing, state management, API calls for which we will have to 
   depend on other third party libraries
 - React uses client side rendering where components are generated in the browser using javascript
 - This can cause problem for SEO and indexing 
 - To solve this we can use Nextjs which is a React frame work


What is DOM (document object model)
 - It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects
 - The DOM allows scripts like JavaScript to access and manipulate the content, structure, 
   and style of a web page after it has been loaded by a browser

Virtual Dom 
 - VDOM is a concept used by js libraries like React to improve performance of the web applications
 - It's a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
