## React Fiber

- React fiber is a complete rewrite of React's Core reconciliation algorithm, introduced in react 16
- It was designed to address the limitations of the previous asynchronous reconciler by implementing **incremental rendering** and **asychoronous updates**

### The older reconciler: Stack Reconciler

**Limitations :-**

- **synchronous execution:** It relied on the **_javascript call stack_** for its operation
  This means that when the once reconciliation began - it would complete synchronously, potentially blocking the main thread and making UI unresponsive for large applications

- **Limited Interruptibility:** we cannot pause or prioritize task
- etc..

### The New Reconciler: Fiber Reconciler

- The fiber reconciler breaks down the process of updating UI into small manageable units of work called fibers
- This allows the React to handle updates asynchronously

The reconciliation process is split into two phases

- **Render Phase:** In this phase, React performs calculations to build a new Fiber tree (called the "work-in-progress" tree) and identify all the changes that need to be made. This phase is interruptible and can be paused or resumed, ensuring that high-priority tasks (like user input) can take precedence.

  - asynchronous
  - tasks can be priortized, paused, discarded

- **Commit Phase:** In this phase, React synchronously applies all the changes computed in the render phase to the actual DOM. This is the only part of the process that is visible to the user and cannot be interrupted.

#### Key advantages of the Fiber Reconciler

- **Incremental Rendering:** Instead of doing all the work at once, Fiber breaks down the rendering process into smaller, interruptible units. It can:

  - **Pause and Resume**: React can pause a rendering task to let the browser handle a higher-priority task, like a user's keypress or a critical animation frame, and then resume the rendering when the browser is idle.

  - **Prioritize task:** It can assign different priority levels to updates. High-priority tasks (e.g., user input) are executed immediately, while lower-priority tasks (e.g., a background data fetch) can be deferred. This is known as cooperative scheduling, where React cooperates with the browser to keep the UI responsive.
