### Difference between Fibre, React element and virtual DOM
A React element, the Virtual DOM, and Fiber are three distinct but interconnected concepts that represent different levels of abstraction in a React application.

- A React element is the smallest unit, a simple object. ( build my React.createElement() )

- The Virtual DOM is a high-level concept for efficient UI representation.

- Fiber is the technical implementation that brings the Virtual DOM concept to life in modern React.


**React Element** 
A React element is a lightweight, plain JavaScript object that describes a part of your UI. It's the blueprint for a specific piece of a component or a native DOM element. When you write JSX like `<h1>Hello</h1>`, it gets converted into a React element. It's the "what to render" instruction for React.

**Virtual DOM (VDOM)**
The Virtual DOM is a conceptual model. It's an in-memory tree of React elements that acts as a blueprint for the real DOM. When your application's state changes, React builds a new VDOM tree and compares it to the previous one using a process called diffing. The VDOM's purpose is to make UI updates faster by minimizing direct manipulation of the slow real DOM.

**React Fiber** 
React Fiber is the specific implementation of the VDOM in modern React (version 16+). It's an advanced data structure—a linked list of "fiber" nodes—that replaced the older VDOM algorithm. Fiber allows React to perform incremental rendering, meaning it can pause and resume rendering work. This is the key to enabling features like task prioritization and a smoother user experience, as it prevents long-running renders from freezing the UI.
