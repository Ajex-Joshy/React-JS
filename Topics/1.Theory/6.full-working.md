**1. Transpilation:** You write JSX code. During the build process, a transpiler like Babel converts your JSX into React.createElement() function calls.

**2. Element Creation:** The React.createElement() function returns a React element. This element is a lightweight JavaScript object that acts as a blueprint for a DOM node.

**3. Initial Render:** You pass this React element to ReactDOM.createRoot().render(). This marks the beginning of the render phase.

**4. Render Phase:** React's Fiber reconciler builds or updates a Fiber tree based on the React elements. This phase is interruptible. It performs the diffing by comparing the new Fiber tree with the old one to identify what needs to change.

**5. Commit Phase:** Once the render phase is complete, React enters the commit phase. This phase is synchronous and uninterruptible. It's when React takes the changes identified during diffing and applies them to the actual real DOM.


**NB**: VDOM is the concept and Fiber tree is the concrete data structure that implements that concept,
enabling React's advanced features like incremental rendering and task prioritization.

In the old verion we has the JS objects as the VDOM
In the new version we have fiber (linked list) as the VDOM

**In the modern React reconciliation process, the Fiber tree is the Virtual DOM.** 

so VDOM is the tree representation of the UI
