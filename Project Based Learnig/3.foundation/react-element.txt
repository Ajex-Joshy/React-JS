React Element
A React element is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the screen. 
It is not a real HTML element, but a blueprint for one.

Key points:
	•	Immutable: once created, it cannot be changed.
	•	Created using React.createElement() or JSX.
	•	Contains type, props, and children.
	•	React uses it to update the Virtual DOM efficiently.


const heading = <h1 id="heading">Hello World</h1>;

React internally converts it into:

React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Hello World"
)
