    Hooks are basically predifined function in react
React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components

lets see what is state 
State in React refers to a special kind of object that is used to store dynamic data in a component. 
Unlike variables, when state changes, the component re-renders automatically, so the UI always stays in 
sync with the data.


so to make a state variable we will use a hook called useState that we have to import from react 
lets see how to make a state variable 

<script>
    import { useState } from "react" // useState is exported as named export from react in node modules\

    const Counter = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
        return (
            
            // here count is the state variable
            // setCount is the function to update count. we will pass updated data as parameter
            // useState() is the hook. we will pass the inital value as parameter
            // if any change is made to count variable using SetCount the ui will automatically re-render

            <div className="btn-container">
                <button onclick={()=> setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
                <P>you clicked button {count} times</P>
            </div>
        )
    }
    
</script>


lets see difference between State and Props  

State vs Props:  

- State is managed inside a component and can change over time.  
- Props are passed from parent to child and are read-only.  

<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Feature</th><th>State</th><th>Props</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Definition</td><td>Data managed inside a component</td><td>Data passed from parent to child</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mutability</td><td>Mutable (can be updated with setState / setCount)</td><td>Immutable (cannot be changed by child)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ownership</td><td>Local to the component</td><td>Owned by parent component</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Use Case</td><td>For dynamic, interactive data</td><td>For passing values, configurations</td></tr>
</table>

Example:  

<script>
    const Child = ({ title }) => {
        return <h2>{title}</h2> // title is a prop
    }

    const Parent = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0) // count is state
        return (
            <div>
                <Child title="This is a prop example" />
                <p>Count is {count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
            </div>
        )
    }
</script>

üîπ 1. Virtual DOM (VDOM)
	‚Ä¢	What it is:
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
It is a JavaScript object that mirrors the real DOM structure.
	‚Ä¢	Why it‚Äôs needed:
Direct DOM manipulation is slow because browsers recalculate styles, layouts, and re-render elements.
The VDOM makes UI updates faster by:
	1.	Creating a virtual copy of the UI.
	2.	Updating only the parts that changed instead of re-rendering the entire DOM.
	‚Ä¢	How it works:
	1.	React builds a virtual tree (VDOM) whenever the component renders.
	2.	When state/props change, React creates a new VDOM.
	3.	React compares the new VDOM with the old one (diffing).
	4.	Only the differences (patches) are updated in the real DOM.

‚∏ª

üîπ 2. Diff Algorithm

React uses a reconciliation algorithm (diffing) to compare the old and new VDOM efficiently.
	‚Ä¢	Naive diffing: Comparing two DOM trees node-by-node ‚Üí O(n¬≥) complexity (too slow).
	‚Ä¢	React‚Äôs optimized diffing: Uses heuristics to reduce it to O(n).

Main rules React follows:
	1.	Element type comparison
	‚Ä¢	If two elements have different types, React destroys the old tree and builds a new one.
	‚Ä¢	Example: <div> ‚Üí <span> means React removes the div and creates a span.
	2.	Same type elements
	‚Ä¢	React compares attributes/props and only updates the changed ones.
	‚Ä¢	Example: <button class="red"> ‚Üí <button class="blue"> updates only class.
	3.	Lists (keys are important)
	‚Ä¢	React uses keys to identify items in a list.
	‚Ä¢	If keys match ‚Üí React reuses the element.
	‚Ä¢	If keys don‚Äôt match ‚Üí React destroys and rebuilds.
	‚Ä¢	Example:

const list = items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)

üîπ 3. React Fiber
	‚Ä¢	What it is:
React Fiber is the new reconciliation engine (since React 16).
It allows React to split rendering work into chunks and spread it over multiple frames ‚Üí asynchronous rendering.
	‚Ä¢	Why Fiber?
The old algorithm was synchronous (once started, it couldn‚Äôt be interrupted).
Large updates blocked the UI ‚Üí poor performance.
	‚Ä¢	Features of Fiber:
	1.	Incremental rendering ‚Üí work can be paused, resumed, or aborted.
	2.	Prioritization ‚Üí important updates (like user input) are handled first.
	3.	Concurrency ‚Üí React can prepare multiple versions of UI and commit the best one.
	‚Ä¢	Fiber Architecture:
	‚Ä¢	Each element is represented as a Fiber Node (a JS object).
	‚Ä¢	Fiber nodes keep track of:
	‚Ä¢	Component type
	‚Ä¢	Pending props
	‚Ä¢	State
	‚Ä¢	Child, sibling, and parent fibers

üîπ 4. Reconciliation
	‚Ä¢	What it is:
The process React uses to update the DOM when state/props change.
	‚Ä¢	Steps:
	1.	Render phase:
	‚Ä¢	React builds a new VDOM tree.
	‚Ä¢	Fiber breaks rendering work into units (Fiber Nodes).
	‚Ä¢	Diff algorithm compares old tree vs new tree.
	‚Ä¢	This phase is interruptible (can pause for high-priority tasks).
	2.	Commit phase:
	‚Ä¢	React applies the changes to the real DOM.
	‚Ä¢	This phase is synchronous (cannot be interrupted).
	‚Ä¢	Two phases analogy:
	‚Ä¢	Render phase = ‚ÄúPlanning what to update.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Commit phase = ‚ÄúActually updating the DOM.‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Quick Summary:
	‚Ä¢	Virtual DOM: Efficient copy of the real DOM.
	‚Ä¢	Diff Algorithm: Compares old vs new VDOM (O(n) optimization).
	‚Ä¢	React Fiber: New reconciliation engine ‚Üí allows async, prioritized updates.
	‚Ä¢	Reconciliation: Full process of updating UI ‚Üí Render phase + Commit phase.
